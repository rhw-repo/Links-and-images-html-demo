    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Pug Talk was created by Bob the Pug in 1992. Our website still holds true to that 90s aesthetic, caputred in our glowing lack of just about everything and a ton of fugly white space and words.</p>
    
    <p>Bob saw the need for pugs to be able to talk, without being harrassed by other way huger dogs in a park or some human insisting they leave the park or stop sniffing something nasty.</p>
